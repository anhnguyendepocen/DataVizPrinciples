# Goals

+ Describe the roles of graphics for research.
+ Contrast the features and utility of different plot types.
+ Identify what plots to make (and why) for a given question and dataset.
+ Effectively use graphical elements (color, annotations, aesthetics, line types, etc.) to improve plots.
+ Implement best practices to maximize the impact of graphical displays.

## Take home

+ Don't just make plots.
+ Think about your purpose, message, audience and medium *before* and *during* the process.
+ Faithfully represent your data.
  
## "Case studies"
  + Evaluate and compare different compositions
  + Learn by doing, and re-doing ...

# Purposes of Data Visualization
## When to viz in the research data pipeline

+ Cleaning data
  + errors in the data
  + outliers
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  + summarize the data
  + identify patterns
+ Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)
  + model fit
  + residuals
+ Communicating findings:
  + collaborators (internal reports)
  + colleagues (publications)
  + public (outreach)

+ Debugging code
  + e.g. when reading complex data

# Purposes of Data Visualization
## Before you start

  *Who* is your audience?
  *What* is your goal? The intended message?
  *Where* and how will it be presented?
  *Why* do you need a viz?
  
--

# Purposes of Data Visualization 
## Know your medium

# How
  + Projector, paper, screen, ...

# What
  + Static
  + Dynamic, interactive plots
    + brushing
    + linked plots
  + Dashboards/Apps

# Constraints
  + Resolution, color, ...

---
# Visualization Requires Effort

+ "a picture is worth a 1000 words"
  + 'plot(x, y)'
  + good software makes it (too) easy

+ What *plot* presents your *message* to your *audience* most *effectively*?

+ In many cases, the type of plot really is obvious
  + e.g. a scatterplot
+ But what about
   + additional variables via color, glyph
   + text annotations
   + confidence intervals
   + panel plots
   + different scales on the axes
   + a caption

+ Help yourself and your audience
  + Does the plot faithfully articulate your data *and* your message?
  + Could others focus on a different message? 
    + What's the risk of mis-interpretation?
    + Is there a better way to help them pay attention to what you want them to see?
    + Are there any implicit biases at play?

<!-- Move -->
+  Gratuitous use of colors can lead the viewer to try to interpret them.
   <!--   Age Structure of College Enrolment (1972-1976) in Ross's slides Lec 3 -->



---
# What's the goal

+ allow the viewer to look up value for individual observation/group
+ compare at higher-level, lower-resolution.

+ Tables versus plots


---

# Visual Perception

+ encoding information through attributes
  + length, color, glyph, ...
+ Stevens
+ Cleveland & McGill
+ paldhous.github.io and comparison of the 3 chart types for the same data.

# Pie Chart

+ When are they best?
+ When are they okay?




+  tend to underestimate acute angles and overestimate obtuse ones
     connect to  Poggendorff illusion
+ angle judgements depend on orientations. Angles whose bisectors are horizontal tend to be seen as larger than whose bisectors are vertical

# Wordclouds

+ Frequency represented by font size.
+􏱁 Neither area nor height corresponds to frequency of words.
+􏱁 How do longer words compare with shorter words?
+􏱁 How are capital letters handled?
+􏱁 How to calculate relative difference in frequency between
two words?
+􏱁 How are the words ordered within the cloud (alphabetical,
frequency)?

# Drawing Good Graphs
<!-- Ross lect 3 last page. -->
• If the “story” is simple, keep it simple.
• If the “story” is complex, make it look simple. • Tell the truth – don’t distort the data.

# Essential Elements

<!-- These go without saying, so let's make certain to say them -->


+ Data !
+ Labels on the axes
   + Units for the measurements
+ Title for the plot
+ Legend
+ Caption if part of text (not standalone)
  + Say what the reader should focus on and provide the
    textual summary/message.
  + Not all viewers will have the same interpretation as you.
+ Self-contained details for interpretation.
  + Or connect to other explanatory material.

+ Adherence to perception principles

+ Iterate and edit.

+ When you subset data to "zoom in" on a plot,
  the same plot or composition is not necessarily appropriate.
<!-- example  log scale -->

# Color

+ Decpmposition HSV
+ blindness
+ Cindy Brewer

+ “get it right in black and white”.
  + E.g. Use luminance for grayscale version

---
# EDA
+ Purpose?
+ Viewer:
   + you by yourself
   + with your collaborators

# Single Variable (Univariate)

+ Consider rentals in the East Bay (Berkeley, Oakland)



+ How to summarize/"understand" price of rental units


???

+ Ideally, they say mean
  + What about the spread?  SD, IQR
  + Doesn't the use of the mean assume not skewed?
  + Need more than simple summaries
  + Need to look at the distribution of all the values
     + Plot them all on the number line

# Tricky Optimization Problem

+ "Simple" least squares problem
+ 3 parameters
+ Try different starting values and the optimization doesn't move
  from some of these
  + What's the problem?
  + How to go about understanding the issue?

<!--
     Create a grid for different combinations of the 3 parameters
     and evaluate the SSE at each combination of parameters. 
     Say 100 values for each parameter, so 100^3 combinations
     Now we have 4 variables.
     How to see SEE as the three parameters vary?
