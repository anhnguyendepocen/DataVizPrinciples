<!-- 

Measurements taken in 3 different periods
```
plot(density(as.numeric(d$time)))
```

How many unique x, y points
166
length(unique(with(d, sprintf("%f,%f", x,y))))

How many observations at each point
dotchart(sort(table(with(d, sprintf("%f,%f", x, y))))) :

So from 6500 to 8500
Does this vary by which of the 3 time periods the measurements were taken?
How would we plot this?
